HackerRank 3-Month Prep Kit

In each file, I've chosen just to keep the "implement this" function, so I can use standard Go tooling around testing and benchmarks. I have no desire to maintain the HackerRank crust for stdin / stdout handling. The only difference I need to account for on HackerRank is that, instead of returning values like I do here, I'll have to print them to stdout. Just be easy to pop that into a template.

All tests are from Goland's "Generate Test For Function" templating. Not how I would normally write table-driven tests, but close enough.
